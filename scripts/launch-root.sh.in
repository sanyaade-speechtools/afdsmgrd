# This script uses the same environment variables defined in sysconfig file of
# afdsmgrd to set the environment for ROOT and launch it with the given
# parameters.
#
# It has been created to overcome a "problem" with setuid programs like
# afdsmgrd: in these programs, LD_LIBRARY_PATH is unset right after changing
# privileges to avoid unprivileged user to change the environment that may
# potentially affect the execution of the daemon as a privileged user.

# Get the configuration variables from the first configuration file found
