# Variable with name of redirector
set PMASTER=pmaster.to.infn.it

# Standard PROOF dataset source
xpd.datasetsrc file url:/pool/datasets mss:root://$PMASTER:1094 opt:Cq:Av:Ar: rw=1

# Originating URL will be converted to redirector's according to this scheme
verifier.urlregex alien://(.*)$ root://$PMASTER/$1

# Sleep between each queue check
verifier.sleepsecs 6

#Â Verified data on queue is saved on datasets every X seconds
verifier.scandseveryloops 10

# Parallel verifications: there is no upper limit, and it has been proven to
# handle thousands of elements. It is however better to keep this number not too
# high and to lower the "sleepsecs"
verifier.parallelverifies 800

# Command that performs the file verification -- variables will be substituted.
# With current distribution, you may choose between two different methods:
#
# 1) ROOT macro with option to do only locate (0) or rescan metadata (1)
#verifier.verifycmd @DIR_LIBEXEC@/afdsmgrd-root.sh -b -q @DIR_LIBEXEC@/afdsmgrd-macros/Verify.C'("$REDIRURL", "$TREENAME", 0)'
#
# 2) External script that wraps "xrd locateall" (way faster and lighter)
verifier.verifycmd @DIR_LIBEXEC@/afverifier-xrd-locate.sh "$REDIRURL"

# Maximum number of failures tolerated: verifications are failed after that
verifier.maxfailures 3
